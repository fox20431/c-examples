# C Examples

This repository is for coding C example to learning how C syntax work.

## Get started

Use the Linux

### Config environment

1. Install GCC firstly

    for example:

    ```
    sudo apt install build-essensial
    ```

2. Install `Visual Stuido Code` and install `C/C++ Extension Pack` extension.

### Code

I recommand to use `visual studio code` to open the repo directory, becasue I have coded tasks for the editor, and you can use `ctrl + shift + b` to build the current code, and press `F5` to run the current file.
